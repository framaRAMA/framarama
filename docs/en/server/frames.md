# Frames

A frame is a configuration contain used to group and configure photo
collections. It defines which photos to show, how to process them, how
to priorize them and much more.

The system can manage multiple frames to separate and configure different
photo collections.

## Info

Common information about a frame can be specified here:

* **Name** - a short name
* **Description** - a longer description
* Enabled - a status if processing should take place or not
* Displays - a list of displays using this frame

## Sources

To specify which photos should be placed into the collection a source
need to be configured. It is possible to setup multiple sources for
a frame (e.g. add some photos from collection A and some photos from
collection B).

### Info

Each source have some basic settings:

* **Name** - a name
* **Update interval** - the interval to refresh the collection
* **Result mapping** - list of fields to map (for ID, for URL, for take date)
* Meta mapping - optionally more additional meta fields

The info page shows the common information about the source. It provides
also information about the last update run of the photo collection.

### Queue

To specify where to get the photo collection actually, a queue is setup.
This consists of multiple items where at the end of the queue will drop
out a list of photo URLs.

Some different types of steps can be added to the queue (e.g. load and
URL via HTTP, transform or filter the data, etc.). These types are called
source plugins.

When using a type of plugin multiple times in the queue,
they are run separately. But in some cases you need to use the same type
of plugin running in the same context (e.g. when logging into a web site
in one step, and loading some data requiring the authentication before).

Depending on the type of the plugin some information need to be provided.
Details about the source plugins are described in the plugin section.

Use the "‚ûï" (add) button to add a new step or the "‚ñ∂" (play) button to
start an update.


### Items

To review the items in the current photo collection this page can be used
to view the resulting collection. It shows some details (id, thumbnail, URL) and
provides a basic search functionality.

## Sorting

The sorting can be used to reorder or priorize the photos in the collection
by some criteria.

Depending on the type of the plugin some information need to be provided.
Details about the source plugins are described in the plugin section.

Use the "‚ûï" (add) button to add a new sorting.

## Finishing

When displaying a photo on a digital digiframe the source photo requires
some preparations (e.g. resize to the geometry of the display, add some
blurred borders, etc.). These operations can be defined in this page.

There are different plugins to manipulate the source photo and each operation
can generate a new image or an additional image.

Details about the finishing plugins are described in the plugin section.

Use the "‚ûï" (add) button to add a new finishing or the "üëÅ" (eye) button to
preview the current set with an random image of the photo collection.

## Context

The context is used to provide some (meta) information for the finishing.
This could be the general EXIF information of the photo or the resolved geo
location (the country, city, etc.).

Details about the context plugins are described in the plugin section.

Use the "‚ûï" (add) button to add a new context.
